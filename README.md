<!--
 Commenting these out until we have at least a sample for them in the repo:
 - [Deep Learning VM Images](dlvm)
 - [Data Label Services](https://cloud.google.com/data-labeling/docs/)
 - [Built-in Algorithms](built_in_algorithms)
 -->

## Getting Started

We highly recommend that you start with our [Quick Start Sample](./quickstart).

## Navigating this Repository

This repository is organized based on the available products on AI Platform, and the typical Machine Learning problems 
that developers are trying to solve. For instance, if you are trying to train a model with [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org), 
you will find the sample under [training/sklearn/structured/base](./training/sklearn/structured/base) directory.
AI Platform also supports [xgboost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org), and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/).

Please refer to the `README.md` file in each sample directory for more specific instructions.


## Google Machine Learning Repositories

If youâ€™re looking for our guides on how to do Machine Learning on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using other services, please checkout our other repositories: 

- [ML on GCP](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/ml-on-gcp), which has guides on how to bring your code from various ML frameworks to [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) using things like [Google Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute/) or [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/).
- [Keras Idiomatic Programmer](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/keras-idiomatic-programmer) This repository contains content produced by Google Cloud AI Developer Relations for machine learning and artificial intelligence. The content covers a wide spectrum from educational, training, and research, covering from novices, junior/intermediate to advanced.
